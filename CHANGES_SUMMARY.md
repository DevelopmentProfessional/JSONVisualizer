# JSON Visualizer Improvements - Summary

## Changes Implemented

### 1. JSON Explorer Node Lines Behind Text
- **Issue**: Node connection lines were appearing on top of text, making it hard to read
- **Solution**: Modified the D3.js rendering order to draw links first, then nodes and text
- **File**: `view.html` (around line 767)
- **Details**: 
  - Added links before nodes in the rendering sequence
  - Added slight opacity (0.6) to links for better visual hierarchy
  - Added comment clarifying the rendering order

### 2. Input Groups for Visualization Fields
- **Issue**: Labels and inputs were on separate lines, taking up unnecessary space
- **Solution**: Converted form fields to Bootstrap input groups for compact layout
- **Files**: `view.html`
- **Areas Changed**:
  - Data Source selector: "Select API Response" field
  - Visualization selector: "Graph Type" field
  - Mapping inputs: All dynamic mapping fields for graph configuration
- **Benefits**: 
  - More compact UI
  - Better visual alignment
  - Consistent with modern form design patterns

### 3. Expandable and Resizable Control Panel
- **Issue**: Fixed-size control panel was not flexible for different screen sizes
- **Solution**: Made the entire control panel expandable/collapsible and resizable
- **Features Implemented**:
  - **Collapsible Header**: Click the header to expand/collapse the entire panel
  - **Resizable Container**: Users can drag the corners to resize width and height
  - **State Persistence**: Panel size and collapse state saved to GraphConf.json
  - **Auto-save**: Changes are automatically saved when resizing or toggling
  
### 4. SaveGraphControlSize API
- **Purpose**: Persist control panel size and state across sessions
- **Endpoint**: `POST /SaveGraphControlSize`
- **File**: `server.js`
- **Request Format**:
  ```json
  {
    "width": "400px",
    "height": "700px", 
    "collapsed": false
  }
  ```
- **Storage**: Saves to `data/GraphConf.json` under `controlPanelState` section
- **Integration**: 
  - Automatic saving when panel is resized
  - Debounced saves (500ms delay) to prevent excessive API calls
  - State restoration on page load

## Configuration Structure

The `GraphConf.json` file now includes a new `controlPanelState` section:

```json
{
  "nodePositions": { ... },
  "graphControls": { ... },
  "hierarchicalControls": { ... },
  "explorerControls": { ... },
  "controlPanelState": {
    "width": "320px",
    "height": "600px",
    "collapsed": false
  }
}
```

## Technical Details

### CSS Changes
- Added `.control-panel-header` styling for the collapsible header
- Added `.control-panel-content` for the main content area
- Updated `#controlNav` to support resizing with `resize: both`
- Added transition effects for smooth expand/collapse

### JavaScript Functions Added
- `toggleControlPanel()`: Handles expand/collapse functionality
- `saveControlPanelState()`: Saves current panel state to server
- `loadControlPanelState()`: Loads saved state on page initialization
- ResizeObserver integration for automatic save on resize

### Server API Updates
- New `SaveGraphControlSize` endpoint for dedicated panel state management
- Enhanced `UpdateGraphConfiguration` to handle `controlPanelState` if needed
- Default state initialization for new installations

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Space Efficiency**: Input groups make better use of horizontal space
2. **Customization**: Users can resize the control panel to their preference
3. **Persistence**: Panel settings are remembered across browser sessions
4. **Visual Clarity**: JSON Explorer links no longer interfere with text readability
5. **Responsive Design**: Panel can be collapsed for more workspace area

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test panel resizing and verify state persistence after page reload
2. Verify JSON Explorer links appear behind text properly
3. Check that all input group layouts display correctly
4. Test collapse/expand functionality
5. Ensure API endpoint correctly saves and loads panel state

## Files Modified

- `view.html`: Main UI improvements and client-side functionality
- `server.js`: New API endpoint and enhanced configuration handling  
- `GraphConf.json`: Added default controlPanelState section
- `CHANGES_SUMMARY.md`: This documentation file

## Future Enhancements

- Add panel position saving (not just size)
- Multiple panel layouts/presets
- Keyboard shortcuts for expand/collapse
- Panel transparency controls
- Drag-to-move panel functionality
